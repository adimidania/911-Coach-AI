Sometimes a person can be revived after cardiac arrest, particularly if treatment is started immediately. However, the more time that passes without oxygen-containing blood being pumped to the brain, the less likely it is that the person can be revived, and, if revived, the more likely it is that the person will have brain damage.\\n\\nBrain damage is likely if cardiac arrest lasts for more than 5 minutes without the first aid intervention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Death is likely if cardiac arrest lasts for more than 8 minutes. Thus, CPR for cardiac arrest must be started as quickly as possible.\\n\\nCardiac arrest can be caused by anything that makes the heart stop beating. One common cause, especially in adults, is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Another possible cause is stopping breathing, such as when a person drowns or has a severe lung infection or severe asthma attack.\\n\\nA person in cardiac arrest lies motionless and does not respond to questions or to stimulation, such as shaking. The person may not be breathing or may have gasping, irregular breaths called agonal breathing.\",\n          \"CPR: How Effective Is It Really?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn television and in the movies, people who collapse due to cardiac arrest and receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) often awaken during, or after, CPR is done.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn real life, it is much less likely that people will be revived by CPR itself. Instead, CPR is done to circulate oxygen-containing blood from the lungs to the brain and organs until the heart can be restarted with a defibrillator, often with the help of special drugs given by emergency medical services personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly a small percentage of people who suffer cardiac arrest will survive until they reach a hospital. Even those who reach the hospital alive often die as a result of the underlying heart problem before they can be discharged. Of those people who are able to leave the hospital, many will not regain their normal mental function. The most important factors that influence whether a person will survive cardiac arrest and return to normal life after hospital discharge are early initiation of CPR and early defibrillation.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually in television or film, CPR is done on a young, relatively healthy person, sometimes someone who has suffered a serious injury. In reality, most people who need CPR are older adults who often have many serious underlying illnesses. These people are much less likely to have a good outcome after CPR. Also, CPR is rarely effective if the cause of cardiac arrest is a traumatic injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn television and film, the person either dies or recovers fully. In reality, many people who survive cardiac arrest have serious disabilities as a result of the lack of blood flow to the brain.\",\n          \"Start of labor\\r\\nLabor usually begins with\\r\\n\\r\\nContractions in the lower abdomen at regular intervals\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes back pain\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman who has had rapid deliveries in previous pregnancies should notify her doctor as soon as she thinks she is going into labor. When contractions in the lower abdomen first start, they may be weak, irregular, and far apart. They may feel like menstrual cramps. As time passes, uterine contractions become longer, stronger, and closer together. Contractions and back pain may be preceded or accompanied by other signs of labor, such as the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nBloody show: A small discharge of blood mixed with mucus (passing the \\\"mucus plug\\\") from the vagina may be an early sign that labor is about to start. However, bloody show may also occur as a result of sexual intercourse. The bloody show may appear as early as 72 hours before contractions start. Pregnant women should contact their healthcare professional if any vaginal bleeding occurs, because an evaluation at a doctor's office or hospital may be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRupture of membranes: Usually, the fluid-filled membranes that contain the fetus (amniotic sac) rupture during labor, and the amniotic fluid flows out through the vagina. This event is commonly described as \\u201cthe water breaks.\\u201d Occasionally, the membranes rupture before labor starts. Rupture of membranes before labor begins is called prelabor rupture of membranes. Some women feel a gush of fluid from the vagina, followed by steady leaking. Sometimes it is difficult to know if the leaking fluid is amniotic fluid, urine, or vaginal discharge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a woman\\u2019s membranes rupture, she should contact her doctor or midwife immediately. About 80 to 90% of women whose membranes rupture at or near their due date go into labor spontaneously within 24 hours. If labor has not started after several hours and the baby is due, women are usually admitted to the hospital, where labor is artificially started (induced) to reduce the risk of infection. After the membranes rupture, bacteria from the vagina can enter the uterus more easily and cause an infection in the woman, the fetus, or both.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a woman with prelabor rupture of membranes is admitted to a birthing center, oxytocin (which causes the uterus to contract) or a similar medication, such as a prostaglandin, is used to induce labor. However, if the membranes rupture more than 6 weeks before the due date (preterm, or before the 34th week), doctors do not typically induce labor until the fetus is more mature.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MSD manual\",\n          \"Mayo Clinic blog\",\n          \"FDA US Website\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr#Standard-CPR_v79738937\",\n          \"https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/labor-and-delivery/labor\",\n          \"https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr/cardiac-arrest-and-cpr#Standard-CPR_v79738929\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
